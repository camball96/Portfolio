                    <p> My name is Cameron Ball and I would like to introduce myselfâ€¦
                        At this stage in my career, I am in search of an organisation that is seeking an authentic and dynamic
                        task driven innovator.
                        I come equipped with an exceptional ability to facilitate all aspects of internal and external
                        communication and able to work under strict time sensitive environments.
                        I thrive at ensuring strategic alliance with organisational leaders and peers to effectively align with
                        key company values and initiatives.
                        My skill set extends to a meticulous level of attention to detail which I believe uncovers opportunity
                        for innovation and growth.
                        My past accomplishment has been building a start up company that required a pragmatic and
                        focused approach when negotiating in domestic and international operations.
                        I am particularly proud of my versatility, optimism and ability to establish and build rapport, trust
                        and credibility with all stakeholders at all levels.
                        I truly believe that I could be a loyal asset to your company and a worthy investment, able to make a
                        difference to an organisation such as yours.
                        Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
